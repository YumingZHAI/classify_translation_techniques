## Preparation work
 
Preprocessing steps for corpus: lowercasing, correcting minor spelling errors. For end2end neural architectures, we also normalized the clitic forms to complete words (e.g. 're -> are), and normalized digits to letter form (e.g. 42 -> four two).

We conducted experiments with balanced binary classes dataset and five-classes dataset.
