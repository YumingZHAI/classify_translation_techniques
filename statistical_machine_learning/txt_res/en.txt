1840 for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , `` something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . '' 
1841 in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what 's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
1842 something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it . 
1843 in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick . 
1844 and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that 's been in every children 's magic book since at least the 1950s . 
1845 i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the 1970s . 
1846 i 'll do it for you , and then i 'll explain it . 
1847 and then i 'll explain why i explained it . 
1848 so , here 's what happens . 
1849 the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine . 
1850 i 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this . 
1851 i 'll get my sleeve back . 
1852 and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i 'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here . 
1853 that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i 'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve . 
1854 and the object of this is quite simple . 
1855 i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife . 
1856 in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off . 
1857 nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . and you can examine everything . 
1858 ta-da ! 
1859 so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it 's a very simple trick methodologically . 
1860 probably many of you in the room know this trick . 
1861 what happens is this . 
1862 i hold the knife in my hand . 
1863 i say i 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie . 
1864 the reason i 'm holding onto my wrist is because that 's actually the secret of the illusion . 
1865 in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this . 
1866 nice one . 
1867 someone who did n't have a childhood is out there . 
1868 so , it goes like this , from here , right . 
1869 and as i move around my finger shifts . 
1870 and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you do n't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it does n't count , one , two , three . it groups them . 
1871 but that 's not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up . 
1872 obviously it 's clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there . 
1873 and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger . 
1874 i take this hand away . you give the knife out . 
1875 there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks . 
1876 now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ? 
1877 i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open . 
1878 i 'm not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing . 
1879 it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that 's like aspirin shaped -- it 's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect . 
1880 but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective . 
1881 even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they 're sugar pills . 
1882 but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill . 
1883 what ? that really flipped me out . 
1884 turns out though , that that 's not even where it stops . 
1885 if you have capsules , they 're more effective than tablets in any form . 
1886 a colored capsule , that 's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule . 
1887 dosage has something to do with this . 
1888 one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- i do n't remember the statistic now . sorry . 
1889 but the point is ... 
1890 ... these dosages have something to do with it . 
1891 and the form has something to do with it . 
1892 and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you 've go to the needle . 
1893 right ? a syringe with some inert -- a couple ccs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ... 
1894 well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it 's so much stronger than the white pill . 
1895 it 's a really , this graph , well i 'll show it to you some other time when we have slides . 
1896 the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle . 
1897 and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality , it 's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect . 
1898 i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick . 
1899 and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real . 
1900 and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle . 
1901 this is a seven-inch hatpin . it 's very , very sharp , and i 'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit . 
1902 this is really my flesh . this is not damian 's special-grown flesh . 
1903 that 's my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect . 
1904 i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side . 
1905 if you 're queasy -- if you faint easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i did n't know , and one woman almost passed out . 
1906 so , i suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i 'll do the first bad part behind it . 
1907 you 'll get to see , you can look away too if you 'd like to . 
1908 so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce . 
1909 i 'm sorry , man . am i freaking you out ? 
1910 ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this . 
1911 now , essentially we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick . 
1912 sort of . 
1913 but you ca n't count my fingers right now can you ? 
1914 so , let me show them to you . that 's one , two three , four , five . 
1915 yes , well ... 
1916 i know what people think when they see this . 
1917 they go , `` well , he 's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes . 
1918 so , let me give you a little peek . 
1919 how 's that look out there ? pretty good . 
1920 yeah , i know . 
1921 and the people in the back go , `` ok , i did n't really see that . '' 
1922 people in the satellite room are starting to move in now . 
1923 let me give you good close look at this . 
1924 that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect . 
1925 that 's my flesh , and i can twist that around . 
1926 i 'm sorry . if you 're getting queasy , look away , do n't look at the thing . 
1927 people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , `` well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there 's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding . 
1928 well let me work up some blood for you . 
1929 yes , there it is . 
1930 normally now , i would take the needle out . 
1931 i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wounds . 
1932 but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i 'm just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage . 
1933 i will be seeing you several times over the next few days . 
1934 i hope you 're looking forward to that . thank you very much . 
814 i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks . 
815 as you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships . 
816 spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us . 
817 so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser pattie , and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ? 
818 this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building siftables . 
819 in a nutshell , a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie . 
820 they 're able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio . 
821 most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping . 
822 and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information . 
823 and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles . 
824 so , i 'm going to start with some simple examples . 
825 this siftable is configured to show video , and if i tilt it in one direction , it 'll roll the video this way ; if i tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards . 
826 and these interactive portraits are aware of each other . 
827 so if i put them next to each other , they get interested . 
828 if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered . 
829 and they can also sense their motion and tilt . 
830 one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid . 
831 so in this case , we 've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed . 
832 if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back . 
833 there are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately . 
834 so here i 'm -- this is a fibonacci sequence that i 'm making with a simple equation program . 
835 here we have a word game that 's kind of like a mash-up between scrabble and boggle . 
836 basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary . 
837 then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try . 
838 so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video . 
839 they really loved it . 
840 and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you do n't have to give people many instructions . 
841 all you have to say is , `` make words , '' and they know exactly what to do . 
842 so here 's another few people trying it out . 
843 that 's our youngest beta tester , down there on the right . 
844 turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up . 
845 so to him , they were just blocks . 
846 now , this is an interactive cartoon application . 
847 and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners . 
848 and this is felix , actually . 
849 and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lifting the siftables off the table that have that character shown on them . 
850 here , he 's bringing the sun out . 
851 the sun is rising . 
852 now he 's brought a tractor into the scene . 
853 the orange tractor . 
854 good job ! yeah ! 
855 so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- woof ! 
856 inventing his own narrative . 
857 hello ! 
858 it 's an open-ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds . 
859 fly away , cat . 
860 so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we 've built recently , in which siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums . 
861 each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use . 
862 and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want . 
863 and you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable . 
864 there are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter . 
865 you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it . 
866 and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence . 
867 so let 's have a look . 
868 we 'll start by putting a lead into two sequence siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead . 
869 now i put a bass line in . 
870 now i 'll put some percussion in . 
871 and now i 'll attach the filter to the drums , so i can control the effect live . 
872 i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other . 
873 and now i 'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression . 
874 i can rearrange the sequence while it plays . 
875 so i do n't have to plan it out in advance , but i can improvise , making it longer or shorter as i go . 
876 and now , finally , i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable , tilted to the left . 
877 so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work . 
878 and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we 're working to bring out of the laboratory . 
879 so the thought i want to leave you with is that we 're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms . 
880 i look forward to talking with all of you . 
881 one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music . 
882 and the source was a man , an african-american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings . 
883 and i 'm telling a story that many of you know , because steve 's columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia . 
884 nathaniel dropped out of juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles . 
885 i encourage all of you to read steve 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you 'll pardon the pun -- in helping nathaniel get off the streets . 
886 i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall . 
887 he had just heard a performance of beethoven 's first and fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself . 
888 he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven 's fourth symphony . 
889 and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me . 
890 now , i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life . 
891 but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him . 
892 and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost . 
893 and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep . 
894 and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy . 
895 so , i just started playing . 
896 and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto . 
897 and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel 's eyes . 
898 it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst . 
899 and nathaniel 's manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace . 
900 and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius . 
901 and we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven and brahms , bruckner , all the b 's , from bartók , all the way up to esa-pekka salonen . 
902 and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level . 
903 he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic . 
904 and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician . 
905 music is medicine . music changes us . 
906 and for nathaniel , music is sanity . 
907 because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality . 
908 and that is an escape from his tormented state . 
909 and i understood that this was the very essence of art . 
910 this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality . 
911 and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us . 
912 and for nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends . 
913 the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him . 
914 and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether we 're at walt disney concert hall or on skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician . 
915 thank you . 
916 bruno giussani : thank you . thanks . 
917 robert gupta . 
918 robert gupta : i 'm going to play something that i shamelessly stole from cellists . 
919 so , please forgive me . 
153 what i 'm going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is seadragon , and it 's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data . 
154 we 're looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through the thing , rearranging it in any way we want . 
155 and it does n't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are . 
156 most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congress , and it 's in the 300 megapixel range . 
157 it does n't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment . it 's also very flexible architecture . 
158 this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-image data . 
159 this is `` bleak house '' by dickens . every column is a chapter . 
160 to prove to you that it 's really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it 's not a picture . 
161 maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book . 
162 i would n't recommend it . 
163 this is a more realistic case . this is an issue of the guardian . 
164 every large image is the beginning of a section . 
165 and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium . 
166 we 've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian . 
167 we 've made up a fake ad that 's very high resolution -- much higher than you 'd be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we 've embedded extra content . 
168 if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here . 
169 or other models , or even technical specifications . 
170 and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate . 
171 we hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- should n't be necessary . 
172 of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this . 
173 and this one i really wo n't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well . 
174 but those are all the roads in the u.s. 
175 superimposed on top of a nasa geospatial image . 
176 so let 's pull up , now , something else . 
177 this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out . 
178 this is a project called photosynth , which really marries two different technologies . 
179 one of them is seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah snavely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-advised by steve seitz at u.w. 
180 and rick szeliski at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration . 
181 and so this is live on the web . it 's powered by seadragon . 
182 you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience . 
183 but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful . 
184 the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies -- all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially . 
185 i 'm not sure if i have time to show you any other environments . 
186 there are some that are much more spatial . 
187 i would like to jump straight to one of noah 's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and it 's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we 've put up on the website . 
188 we had to worry about the lawyers and so on . 
189 this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr . you just type notre dame into flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model . 
190 and so these are all flickr images , and they 've all been related spatially in this way . 
191 and we can just navigate in this very simple way . 
192 you know , i never thought that i 'd end up working at microsoft . 
193 it 's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here . 
194 i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it 's everything from cell phone cameras to professional slrs , quite a large number of them , stitched together in this environment . 
195 and if i can , i 'll find some of the sort of weird ones . 
196 so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on . 
197 somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go . 
198 this is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly . 
199 we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment . 
200 what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visually , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together . 
201 all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that 's greater than the sum of the parts . 
202 you have a model that emerges of the entire earth . 
203 think of this as the long tail to stephen lawler 's virtual earth work . 
204 and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it . 
205 their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered . 
206 if somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else 's photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way . 
207 and of course , a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory . 
208 thank you so much . 
209 do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ? 
210 yes . what this is really doing is discovering . 
211 it 's creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images . 
212 and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images . 
213 and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have . 
214 like when you do a web search for images , you type in phrases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of . 
215 now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ? 
216 then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge . it 's a classic network effect . 
217 blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations . 
218 thanks so much . 
517 last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc . 
518 and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked . 
519 so this is it . and for those of you that were n't there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference . 
520 its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second . 
521 it 's nothing if not ambitious . 
522 this is the machine below geneva . 
523 we take the pictures of those mini-big bangs inside detectors . 
524 this is the one i work on . it 's called the atlas detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
525 spectacular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale . 
526 on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time . 
527 and this picture was taken by atlas . 
528 it caused immense celebration in the control room . 
529 it 's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the lhc , colliding with a piece of the lhc deliberately , and showering particles into the detector . 
530 in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph . 
531 i do n't know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that . 
532 it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact . 
533 about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires . 
534 those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power . 
535 now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , `` no they do n't . they 're small wires . '' 
536 they can do that because when they are very cold they are what 's called superconducting wire . 
537 so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current . 
538 in one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in lhc , there was a manufacturing defect . 
539 so the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance . 
540 this was the result . 
541 now that 's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot . 
542 so we damaged about 50 of the magnets . 
543 we had to take them out , which we did . 
544 we reconditioned them all , fixed them . 
545 they 're all on their way back underground now . 
546 by the end of march the lhc will be intact again . 
547 we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in june or july , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
548 now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refute . 
549 i think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that we 're overreaching , is the value of things like the lhc . 
550 i will leave the final word to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , i suspect , when defending his protege 's useless experiments -- his protege was michael faraday -- said this , `` nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . '' 
551 thank you . 
397 you know , i 've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes . 
398 we 're actually starting at a new point : we 've been digitizing biology , and now we 're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life . 
399 so , we 've always been trying to ask big questions . 
400 `` what is life ? '' is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels . 
401 we 've tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components . 
402 we 've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer . 
403 now we 're trying to ask , `` can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? '' 
404 this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we 've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome . 
405 we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here . 
406 when we look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell . 
407 so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions . 
408 and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ? 
409 can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we 've never been before ? 
410 and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ? 
411 a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material . 
412 so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace . 
413 our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve . 
414 we started this over 15 years ago . 
415 it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments . 
416 but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult . 
417 there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it 's a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are . 
418 so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors . 
419 and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x 174 . 
420 it 's a small virus that kills bacteria . 
421 we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . 
422 the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles . 
423 the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e. coli . 
424 i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model . 
425 they laughed more than you guys are . 
426 and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system . 
427 but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it 's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we 'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are . 
428 design is critical , and if you 're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate . 
429 when we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs . 
430 we actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up . 
431 part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together . 
432 we design unique elements into this . 
433 you may have read that we put watermarks in . 
434 think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t . 
435 triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there 's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids . 
436 so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts . 
437 initially , all we did was autograph it . 
438 some people were disappointed there was not poetry . 
439 we designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together . 
440 and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 . 
441 at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute . 
442 we 're trying to get to the point of automation . 
443 so , this looks like a basketball playoff . 
444 when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they wo n't any longer grow readily in e. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms . 
445 we knew there 's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together . 
446 here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation . 
447 you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart . 
448 twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before . 
449 we have thousands of organisms that can do this . 
450 these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum . 
451 i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment . 
452 in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there . 
453 here 's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically . 
454 this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph . 
455 it 's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope . 
456 these are pictures over about a six-second period . 
457 so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago . 
458 this is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it 's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure . 
459 it 's over 300 million molecular weight . 
460 if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code . 
461 well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ? 
462 obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria . 
463 it 's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that 's what you 've all heard about with cloning . 
464 with bacteria and archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it . 
465 we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you 'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here . 
466 the new chromosome went into the cell . 
467 in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further . 
468 this is a major mechanism of evolution right here . 
469 we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species . 
470 so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology . 
471 there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna . 
472 the chromosome that was in the cell does n't have one ; the chromosome we put in does . 
473 it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome . 
474 it turned blue because of the genes we put in it . 
475 and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell . 
476 all the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it 's exactly what we had transferred in . 
477 so , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dramatically . 
478 now i 've argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution . 
479 and i 've argued that we 're about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion , where there 's massive new speciation based on this digital design . 
480 why do this ? 
481 i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs . 
482 we 're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years . 
483 to put it in context for myself : i was born in 1946 . 
484 there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there 'll be four . 
485 we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion . 
486 it 's going to be a stretch to do it for nine . 
487 we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that 's a hundred million barrels a day . 
488 when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it 's going to be a huge challenge . 
489 then of course , there 's all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere . 
490 we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future . 
491 the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that . 
492 we 're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination . 
493 we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we 're calling combinatorial genomics . 
494 we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day . 
495 when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science . 
496 and it 's just standard selection : we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc. . 
497 this is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we 're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer . 
498 you know , we do n't know necessarily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
499 we 're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels . 
500 you 've seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment . 
501 we have second - and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol . 
502 but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co2 as its feedstock , and so we 're working with designing cells to go down this road . 
503 and we think we 'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months . 
504 sunlight and co2 is one method ... 
505 but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods . 
506 this is an organism we described in 1996 . 
507 it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures . 
508 it takes co2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source . 
509 we 're looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process . 
510 so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of `` what is life ? '' 
511 we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry -- yeah . if you ca n't do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ... 
512 but also , we 're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines . 
513 you 've seen this year with flu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine . 
514 i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance . 
515 here 's what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes . 
516 we 're a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much . 
722 last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent . 
723 but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it does n't show the thickness of the ice . 
724 the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system . 
725 it expands in winter and contracts in summer . 
726 the next slide i show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what 's happened over the last 25 years . 
727 the permanent ice is marked in red . 
728 as you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer . 
729 the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here . 
730 in 25 years it 's gone from this , to this . 
731 this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes . 
732 compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point . 
733 already in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water . 
734 professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter . 
735 whoa ! 
736 she 's okay . the question is whether we will be . 
737 and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north . 
738 this is an annual melting river . 
739 but the volumes are much larger than ever . 
740 this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland . 
741 if you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea . 
742 these flows are increasing very rapidly . 
743 at the other end of the planet , antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet . 
744 last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance . 
745 and west antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting . 
746 that 's equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is greenland . 
747 in the himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers . 
748 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow . 
749 in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city . 
750 the flows have increased . 
751 but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water . 
752 in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the sierra snowpack . 
753 this is hitting the reservoirs . 
754 and the predictions , as you 've read , are serious . 
755 this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires . 
756 and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate . 
757 four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 . 
758 this is a completely unsustainable pattern . 
759 if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing . 
760 in the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans . 
761 look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americas , extending westward , and on either side of the indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans . 
762 the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels . 
763 oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem . 
764 the united states is one of the two largest emitters , along with china . 
765 and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants . 
766 but we 're beginning to see a sea change . 
767 here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed . 
768 however there is a political battle in our country . 
769 and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron . 
770 that image reminded me of something . 
771 around christmas , in my home in tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled . 
772 you probably saw it on the news . 
773 this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america . 
774 this happened around christmas . 
775 one of the coal industry 's ads around christmas was this one . 
776 frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul . 
777 he 's abundant here in america , and he helps our economy grow . 
778 frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday . 
779 he 's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay . 
780 this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia . 
781 the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal . 
782 let me be clear about it . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they do n't know what they 're talking about . 
783 so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns . 
784 this is one of them , part of one of them . 
785 at coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business . 
786 that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal . 
787 the fact is , coal is n't dirty . 
788 we think it 's clean -- smells good , too . 
789 so do n't worry about climate change . 
790 leave that up to us . 
791 clean coal -- you 've heard a lot about it . 
792 so let 's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility . 
793 amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud . 
794 but that 's the sound of clean coal technology . 
795 and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything . 
796 take a good long look : this is today 's clean coal technology . 
797 finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge . 
798 america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis . 
799 the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil . 
800 but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess . 
801 repower america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years . 
802 a plan to put america back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming . 
803 finally , a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems . 
804 repower america . find out more . 
805 this is the last one . 
806 it 's about repowering america . 
807 one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet . 
808 future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid . 
809 new investments to create high-paying jobs . 
810 repower america . it 's time to get real . 
811 there is an old african proverb that says , `` if you want to go quickly , go alone . 
812 if you want to go far , go together . '' 
813 we need to go far , quickly . 
2311 i 'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired . 
2312 i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i 'm writing anything , but i 'd already finished editing the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word `` disabled '' to see what i 'd find . 
2313 let me read you the entry . 
2314 `` disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run-down , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak . 
2315 antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . '' 
2316 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but i 'd just gotten past `` mangled , '' and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed . 
2317 you know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus so i 'm thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ? 
2318 but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me . 
2319 and , needless to say , thank god i was n't using a thesaurus back then . 
2320 i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today i 'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured . 
2321 so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting . 
2322 here 's the updated version of this entry . 
2323 unfortunately , it 's not much better . 
2324 i find the last two words under `` near antonyms , '' particularly unsettling : `` whole '' and `` wholesome . '' 
2325 so , it 's not just about the words . 
2326 it 's what we believe about people when we name them with these words . 
2327 it 's about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values . 
2328 our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people . 
2329 in fact , many ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence . 
2330 so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who 's empowered ? 
2331 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power . 
2332 would n't we want to open doors for them instead ? 
2333 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington , delaware . 
2334 his name was dr. pizzutillo , an italian american , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most americans to pronounce , so he went by dr. p . 
2335 and dr. p always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children . 
2336 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions . 
2337 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything -- i hated them , had names for them . i hated them . 
2338 and , you know , i was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course . 
2339 and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , `` wow . aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you 're going to break one of those bands . 
2340 when you do break it , i 'm going to give you a hundred bucks . '' 
2341 now , of course , this was a simple ploy on dr. p 's part to get me to do the exercises i did n't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me . 
2342 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future . 
2343 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child . 
2344 but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language is n't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable . 
2345 our language has n't caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology . 
2346 certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing . 
2347 so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset . 
2348 the human ability to adapt , it 's an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and i 'm going to make an admission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people 's questions about it , and i think i 'm starting to figure out why . 
2349 implicit in this phrase of `` overcoming adversity '' is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability . 
2350 but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both . 
2351 and i 'm going to suggest that this is a good thing . 
2352 adversity is n't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life . 
2353 it 's part of our life . 
2354 and i tend to think of it like my shadow . 
2355 sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there 's very little , but it 's always with me . 
2356 and , certainly , i 'm not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person 's struggle . 
2357 there is adversity and challenge in life , and it 's all very real and relative to every single person , but the question is n't whether or not you 're going to meet adversity , but how you 're going to meet it . 
2358 so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well . 
2359 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equipped to adapt . 
2360 there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i 'm disabled . 
2361 and , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability i 've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions . 
2362 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we do n't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone . 
2363 perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself . 
2364 by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have . 
2365 we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community . 
2366 so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability . 
2367 and , most importantly , there 's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability . 
2368 so it 's not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity . 
2369 so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it . 
2370 and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we 're less burdened by the presence of it . 
2371 this year we celebrate the 200th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustrated , i think , a truth about the human character . 
2372 to paraphrase : it 's not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change . 
2373 conflict is the genesis of creation . 
2374 from darwin 's work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation . 
2375 so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill . 
2376 and , perhaps , until we 're tested , we do n't know what we 're made of . 
2377 maybe that 's what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power . 
2378 so , we can give ourselves a gift . 
2379 we can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times . 
2380 maybe we can see it as change . 
2381 adversity is just change that we have n't adapted ourselves to yet . 
2382 i think the greatest adversity that we 've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy . 
2383 now , who 's normal ? 
2384 there 's no normal . 
2385 there 's common , there 's typical . there 's no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ? 
2386 i do n't think so . 
2387 if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community . 
2388 anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute . 
2389 there 's evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it 's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community . 
2390 they did n't view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable . 
2391 a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania , and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes . 
2392 it was summertime : i had shorts on . 
2393 i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , `` well , if it is n't aimee mullins . '' 
2394 and i turn around , and it 's this older man . i have no idea who he is . 
2395 and i said , `` i 'm sorry , sir , have we met ? i do n't remember meeting you . '' 
2396 he said , `` well , you would n't remember meeting me . 
2397 i mean , when we met i was delivering you from your mother 's womb . '' 
2398 oh , that guy . 
2399 and , but of course , actually , it did click . 
2400 this man was dr. kean , a man that i had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks . 
2401 and so my mother 's prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents . 
2402 and , because i was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news . 
2403 he said to me , `` i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you 've been making liar out of me ever since . '' 
2404 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the girl scouts , you know , the halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school . 
2405 and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will . 
2406 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone 's life . 
2407 and dr. kean went on to tell me , he said , `` in my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . '' 
2408 see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking . 
2409 he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it . 
2410 and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs , i would n't have hesitated for a second . 
2411 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then . 
2412 but if you ask me today , i 'm not so sure . 
2413 and it 's because of the experiences i 've had with them , not in spite of the experiences i 've had with them . 
2414 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me . 
2415 see , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you 're off . 
2416 if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense . 
2417 you 're teaching them to open doors for themselves . 
2418 in fact , the exact meaning of the word `` educate '' comes from the root word `` educe . '' 
2419 it means `` to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . '' 
2420 so again , which potential do we want to bring out ? 
2421 there was a case study done in 1960s britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools . 
2422 it 's called the streaming trials . we call it `` tracking '' here in the states . 
2423 it 's separating students from a , b , c , d and so on . 
2424 and the `` a students '' get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc. . 
2425 well , they took , over a three-month period , d-level students , gave them a 's , told them they were `` a 's , '' told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at a-level . 
2426 and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the `` a students '' and told them they were `` d 's . '' 
2427 and that 's what happened at the end of that three-month period . 
2428 those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out . 
2429 a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too . 
2430 the teachers did n't know a switch had been made . 
2431 they were simply told , `` these are the ` a-students , ' these are the ' d - students . ' '' and that 's how they went about teaching them and treating them . 
2432 so , i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that 's been crushed does n't have hope , it does n't see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine . 
2433 if instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well . 
2434 when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being . 
2435 i 'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century persian poet named hafiz that my friend , jacques dembois told me about , and the poem is called `` the god who only knows four words '' : `` every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of do n'ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , ` come dance with me . 
2436 come , dance with me . come , dance with me . ' '' thank you . 
1110 if i can leave you with one big idea today , it 's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what i 'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible . 
1111 so what we 're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age . 
1112 this tool that i 'm using here is a little experiment . 
1113 it 's called pivot , and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , accidents . 
1114 and , right away , i see there 's a different pattern that emerges . 
1115 this is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they 're at their most frail . 
1116 we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone . 
1117 if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about . 
1118 and if you drill into that , it 's especially the case for men . 
1119 so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic . 
1120 and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ? 
1121 so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced . 
1122 it 's all here ; it 's all on the web . 
1123 you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk . 
1124 with pivot , you can drill into a decade . 
1125 you can drill into a particular year . 
1126 you can jump right into a specific issue . 
1127 so i 'm looking at this ; i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports . 
1128 i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i 'll go ahead and i 'll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which lance armstrong 's been a part of . 
1129 now , if i want to just kind of take a peek at these , i might think , `` well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? '' 
1130 so i can step back , and expand on that . 
1131 and i see greg lemond now . 
1132 and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out -- you 're not searching , you 're not browsing . 
1133 you 're doing something that 's actually a little bit different . 
1134 it 's in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used . 
1135 so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that 's a little bit crazy . 
1136 what we 're done here is we 've taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary . 
1137 so the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from . 
1138 i 'm only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here . 
1139 but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things . 
1140 right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia . 
1141 i 'm going to go ahead and select government . 
1142 now , having selected government , i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year . 
1143 so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page . 
1144 it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them . 
1145 looking at one of these particular summaries , i can then drill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them . 
1146 so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there 's my boss -- and one has come from music . 
1147 and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner . 
1148 so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize winners . 
1149 so you see , we 're navigating the web for the first time as if it 's actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction . 
1150 and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise . 
1151 i 'm just showing the new york times website here . 
1152 so pivot , this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this . 
1153 so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section . 
1154 now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way . 
1155 so i can drill into what i 've done over specific time frames . 
1156 here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave . 
1157 and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today . 
1158 and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for bing , over here for live labs pivot . 
1159 and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again . 
1160 it 's one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data . 
1161 so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse . 
1162 we talk about the curse of information overload . 
1163 we talk about drowning in data . 
1164 what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ? 
1165 if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information . 
1166 and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge . 
1167 and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wisdom to be found . 
1168 so with that , i thank you . 
1544 several years ago here at ted , peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge . 
1545 and the idea 's pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow . 
1546 the marshmallow has to be on top . 
1547 and , though it seems really simple , it 's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly . 
1548 and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i incorporated it into a design workshop . 
1549 and it was a huge success . 
1550 and since then , i 've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the ctos of the fortune 50 , and there 's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i 'd like to share some of them with you . 
1551 so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task . 
1552 they talk about it , they figure out what it 's going to look like , they jockey for power . 
1553 then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti . 
1554 they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures . 
1555 and then finally , just as they 're running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! -- they admire their work . 
1556 but what really happens , most of the time , is that the `` ta-da '' turns into an `` uh-oh , '' because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse . 
1557 so there are a number of people who have a lot more `` uh-oh '' moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school . 
1558 they lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures . 
1559 and of course there are teams that have a lot more `` ta-da '' structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten . 
1560 and it 's pretty amazing . 
1561 as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they 're the most interesting structures of them all . 
1562 so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ? 
1563 and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti , inc. . right ? 
1564 they do n't spend time jockeying for power . 
1565 but there 's another reason as well . 
1566 and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ? 
1567 and then they execute on it . 
1568 and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ? 
1569 it 's a crisis . 
1570 sound familiar ? right . 
1571 what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way . 
1572 designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process . 
1573 and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what does n't work . 
1574 so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let 's look at how different teams perform . 
1575 so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults . 
1576 who does the very best ? 
1577 architects and engineers , thankfully . 
1578 thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i 've seen . 
1579 and why is it ? because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures . 
1580 so ceos , a little bit better than average , but here 's where it gets interesting . 
1581 if you put you put an executive admin . on the team , they get significantly better . 
1582 it 's incredible . you know , you look around , you go , `` oh , that team 's going to win . '' 
1583 you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ? 
1584 because they have special skills of facilitation . 
1585 they manage the process , they understand the process . 
1586 and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team 's performance . 
1587 specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success . 
1588 if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures . 
1589 and i tried something interesting . 
1590 i thought , let 's up the ante , once . 
1591 so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team . 
1592 so what do you think happened to these design students ? 
1593 what was the result ? 
1594 here 's what happened : not one team had a standing structure . 
1595 if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize . 
1596 so , is n't that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact . 
1597 we did the exercise again with the same students . 
1598 what do you think happened then ? 
1599 so now they understand the value of prototyping . 
1600 so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best . 
1601 they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time . 
1602 so there 's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success . 
1603 so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ? 
1604 and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects . 
1605 and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions . 
1606 the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype . 
1607 and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise . 
1608 and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge.com . 
1609 it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows . 
1610 there 's step-by-step instructions on this . 
1611 there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system . 
1612 there 's world records that are on this as well . 
1613 and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport . 
1614 it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand . 
1615 and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an `` uh-oh '' moment to a `` ta-da '' moment . 
1616 and that can make a big difference . 
1617 thank you very much . 
101 now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on . 
102 well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem is n't change . 
103 all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life . 
104 and the problem is not technology itself . 
105 the sioux indians did not stop being sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and buggy . 
106 it 's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . it is power , the crude face of domination . 
107 wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it 's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan -- a nomadic people from southeast asia , from sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borneo away to the south china sea , where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yanomami , it 's the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold . 
108 or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i 'm doing a lot of research recently , you 'll see it 's a crude face of political domination . 
109 you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people 's way of life , is not only not condemned , it 's universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy . 
110 and you can not understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level . 
111 i once travelled 6,000 miles from chengdu in western china overland through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution . 
112 this young man 's father had been ascribed to the panchen lama . 
113 that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion . 
114 his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal . 
115 his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy . 
116 he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she could n't bear to be without him . 
117 the sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp . 
118 one day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor . 
119 the pain of tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold . 
120 and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ? 
121 margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities . 
122 and it 's humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for -lsb- 150,000 -rsb- years . 
123 the neolithic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago . 
124 the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old . 
125 now , that shallow history does n't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia . 
126 when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices . 
127 and it 's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism . 
128 this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of baffin island when i went narwhal hunting with some inuit people , and this man , olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather . 
129 the canadian government has not always been kind to the inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements . 
130 this old man 's grandfather refused to go . 
131 the family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools . 
132 now , you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it . 
133 the runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide . 
134 so , this man 's grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing . 
135 he simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . and as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade . 
136 he put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it . 
137 he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt . 
138 talk about getting by with nothing . 
139 and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world . 
140 the canadian government in april of 1999 gave back to total control of the inuit an area of land larger than california and texas put together . 
141 it 's our new homeland . it 's called nunavut . 
142 it 's an independent territory . they control all mineral resources . 
143 an amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people . 
144 and finally , in the end , i think it 's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who 've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they 're not remote at all . 
145 they 're homelands of somebody . 
146 they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope . 
147 so , what we 're trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything . 
148 we think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month . 
149 156 nations carry our television channel . 
150 our magazines are read by millions . 
151 and what we 're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we 're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they can not help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being . 
152 thank you very much .
